= Deployment View

This chapter outlines the deployment of the {projectName}, detailing the technical infrastructure required to run the project and all necessary infrastructure elements.

== Deployment of the {projectName}

The deployment process for the individual components of the {projectName} varies.
Below, we provide a brief explanation of how to deploy each component.

=== Blockchain Connector

Since the project-specific Blockchain Connector is deployed within the context of the external project utilizing the {projectName}, detailed discussion regarding it will not be provided here.
However, it's crucial to note that the project-specific blockchain connector must be a Node.js project, so that the Blockchain Connector library can be imported.

As a NestJS library, the Blockchain Connector is used within the project-specific Blockchain Connector.
Instructions for importing modules can be found in the https://docs.nestjs.com/[NestJS documentation].
A tutorial demonstrating how to launch a project-specific Blockchain Connector locally is available in <<chapter-tutorial>>.

The following parameters must be configured in the .env file of the project-specific blockchain connector, with guidance available in the .env.example file:

* **BCC_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED**: Set to true to activate the endpoints (e.g., TokenController, SegmentController) of the Blockchain Connector library. The Swagger documentation under '/api' will include these endpoints.

* **BCC_BLOCKCHAIN_URL**: The URL of the blockchain where the {projectName}'s Smart Contracts are deployed. This blockchain must be accessible from the machine hosting the Blockchain Connector.

* **BCC_BLOCK_TIME**:  Specifies the block time of the blockchain in use.

* **BCC_PRIVATE_KEY**: The private key for signing transactions on the blockchain.

* **BCC_CONTAINER_ADDRESS**: The address of the deployed Container contract. Each external project maintains its own instance, so this can be permanently stored.

* **BCC_TOKEN_ADDRESS**: The address of the deployed Token contract.

* **BCC_CONTAINER_ABI_PATH**: Path to the ABI of the Container Smart Contract.

* **BCC_SEGMENT_ABI_PATH**: Path to the ABI of the Segment Smart Contract.

* **BCC_TOKEN_ABI_PATH**: Path to the ABI of the Segment Smart Contract.

More information on solidity ABI can be found in the https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html/[Soldity ABI documentation].

=== Smart Contracts

The Smart Contracts are deployed on the blockchain using Hardhat, with deployment scripts included in the Smart Contract project.
It's important to configure the necessary entries in the .env file, using the .env.example file as a guide.

* **DEV_NODE_URL**: The URL of the blockchain where the Smart Contracts will be deployed.
* **DEV_MNEMONIC**: The mnemonic providing the private key for deploying the Smart Contracts.
* **DEV_INITIAL_ADDRESS_INDEX**: The index of the derived account from the mnemonic to be used for deployment.
* **TOKEN_NAME**: The name of the token.
* **TOKEN_SYMBOL**: The symbol of the token.
* **CONTAINER_NAME**: The name of the container.

After configuring these details in the .env file, you can execute the deployment scripts using Hardhat.
Once deployed, you must enter the blockchain addresses of the Smart Contracts into the .env file of the Blockchain Connector.
This ensures that the Blockchain Connector can send transactions to the appropriate smart contracts.

=== Hyperledger Besu Blockchain

A Hyperledger Besu network consists of multiple nodes operating in a decentralized manner on separate servers.
A minimum of three nodes is required to initialize the Hyperledger Besu Blockchain.
These nodes can be started on one server and expanded with additional nodes on different servers.
Additionally, it is possible to run a Hyperledger Besu node within a Kubernetes environment.
