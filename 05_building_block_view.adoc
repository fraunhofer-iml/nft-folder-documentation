= Building Block View

The building block view is a static and hierarchical decomposition of the system into building blocks and their relationships.
It is a collection of black box and white box descriptions for all important components.
Building blocks may be modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, etc.).

In blackbox view, only the interface of the component is visible, not its internals.
However, for interface specifications including all method signatures and their descriptions we refer to the link:openAPI.json[OpenAPI documents].
Only other kinds of interfaces are described here.
This is a simplification of arc42 (which requires short description of interfaces), to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies, and to reduce documentation efforts.

== Overview

The {projectName} allows for the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs), converting them into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and storing them on a private Ethereum-based blockchain.
This system consists of three Smart Contracts - Container, Segment, and Token - deployed on a Quorum blockchain, along with two microservices designed to interact with these deployed Smart Contracts.

Each NFT can be linked to a Segment, which, in turn, is part of a Container.
A Container is owned by a single organization and acts as a central hub for managing the organization's Segments and Tokens.
To access the functionalities of the Smart Contracts, a Blockchain Connector is utilized.

The two microservices include the Blockchain Connector and the Project-specific Blockchain Connector.
The latter is specifically tailored for projects integrating the {projectName}, facilitating interaction with the Smart Contracts through the Blockchain Connector interface.

=== Project-specific Blockchain Connector (Blackbox)

The project-specific Blockchain Connector is a web service serving as a bridge between the project and the Blockchain Connector.
It is customized to meet the specific requirements of a given project.
For instance, if a project solely intends to manage tokens using the {projectName}, the project-specific Blockchain Connector will only implement such token management functions.
It will then relay requests to the appropriate endpoints of the Blockchain Connector.

This tailored approach ensures that the project-specific Blockchain Connector precisely aligns with the needs of the project it serves.
By focusing solely on the functionalities relevant to the project's objectives, it optimizes efficiency and streamlines operations within the project's ecosystem.

=== Blockchain Connector (Blackbox)

The Blockchain Connector is a web service that offers a range of functions:

**Segment Management**

* Create a Segment
* Read Segments
* Add a Token to a Segment
* Remove a Token from a Segment

**Token Management**

* Mint a Token
* Read a Token
* Return all Tokens of a Segment
* Update a Token

=== {projectName} Smart Contracts (Whitebox)

The Smart Contracts within the {projectName} encapsulate the core functionality of the system.
They manage Containers, Segments, and Tokens.

|===
|Smart Contract |Description

|Container
|For each organization utilizing the {projectName}, a distinct instance of the Container contract is deployed on the Blockchain. This contract is responsible for the creation of new Segments, which are automatically associated with the Container. Additionally, the Container contract retrieves all Segments belonging to it.

|Segment
|The Segment contract is deployed via the Container contract. Given that the Container contract is owned by a particular organization, the Segment contract created through it is inherently tied to that organization. This contract handles the addition and removal of Tokens from the Segment.

|Token
|The Token contract implements functionality based on the ERC-721 standard. Consequently, it provides functions for the entire lifecycle of NFTs and offers additional features through five extension contracts.

|ERC721AdditionalInformation
|The ERC721AdditionalInformation contract extends the Token contract by providing functions to define and retrieve additional information, represented as a string, to the Token.

|ERC721Asset
|The ERC721Asset contract extends the Token contract by providing functions to define and retrieve the hash and URI of a RWA. The respective RWA is stored externally, not on the blockchain. The URI denotes the location of this external storage, while the hash represents the fingerprint of this RWA and serves to verify the asset's integrity.

|ERC721Metadata
|The ERC721Metadata contract extends the Token contract by providing functions to define and retrieve the hash and URI of the metadata of a RWA. The respective metadata is stored externally, not on the blockchain. The URI denotes the location of this external storage, while the hash represents the fingerprint of this metadata and serves to verify the asset's integrity.

|ERC721RemoteId
|The ERC721RemoteId contract extends the Token contract by providing functions to define and retrieve the specific identifier of a RWA. This identifier serves to uniquely identify the RWA within the external system, such as a database.

|ERC721SegmentAllocation
|The ERC721SegmentAllocation contract extends the Token contract by providing functions of assign and remove a Token from a Segment. A Token can be assigned to multiple Segments as needed.
