= Tutorial

This chapter provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for setting up the components of the {projectName}.
It is designed to ensure a smooth installation process, even for users with limited prior experience.
By carefully following the instructions, you will have the application running quickly and reliably.

Proper preparation of your environment is crucial for a successful installation and use of the {projectName}.
The following sections outline all necessary prerequisites, installation steps, and configuration instructions.
The commands in this guide have been tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS, but adjustments may be required for other operating systems.

For simplicity, this tutorial will start the Blockchain Connector as a microservice rather than integrating it into an existing application as a library.

== Install the Tools

This section explains how to install the required tools to ensure a smooth setup process.

=== Git

Git is essential for version control and for cloning the required repositories from GitHub.

1. *Visit* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git's official website].
2. *Follow* the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. *Verify* the installation with the following command:
[source,shell]
git --version

=== Docker

Docker is required to manage the blockchain.

1. *Visit* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker's official installation guide].
2. *Follow* the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. *Verify* the installation with following command:
[source,shell]
docker --version

=== Node.js

Node.js is required to manage dependencies and execute application.

1. *Visit* https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js's official website].
2. *Follow* the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. *Verify* the installation with the following commands:
[source,shell]
node --version
npm --version

== Clone the Repositories

This section provides instructions for downloading the components of the {projectName} from GitHub.

All repositories are available under the organization https://github.com/fraunhofer-iml[Fraunhofer IML] on GitHub.
For this tutorial wee need the following three repositories: https://github.com/fraunhofer-iml/nft-folder-smart-contracts[nft-folder-smart-contracts], https://github.com/fraunhofer-iml/nft-folder-blockchain-connector[nft-folder-blockchain-connector] and https://github.com/fraunhofer-iml/nft-folder-documentation[nft-folder-documentation].
The `nft-folder-documentation` project is where you are currently reading this documentation.
The `nft-folder-smart-contracts`project contains the smart contracts, and the `nft-folder-blockchain-connector` project contains the blockchain connector.

Since a blockchain network is required to use the {projectName}, we recommend using the https://github.com/fraunhofer-iml/hyperledger-besu-network-configuration[hyperledger-besu-network-configuration] repository from the Fraunhofer GitHub organization instead of the Hardhat network due to custom error issues.

1. *Clone* the `nft-folder-smart-contracts` repository to your local system:
[source,shell]
git clone git@github.com:fraunhofer-iml/nft-folder-smart-contracts.git

2. *Clone* the `nft-folder-blockchain-connector` repository to your local system:
[source,shell]
git clone git@github.com:fraunhofer-iml/nft-folder-blockchain-connector.git

3. *Clone* the `hyperledger-besu-network-configuration` repository to your local system:
[source,shell]
git clone git@github.com:fraunhofer-iml/hyperledger-besu-network-configuration.git

== Set up all Components

=== Start the Blockchain Network

The blockchain network is started using Docker Compose.
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines four services, one for each node: `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, and `dan`.

1. *Navigate* to the `hyperledger-besu-network-configuration` directory:
[source,shell]
cd hyperledger-besu-network-configuration

2. *Build* the Docker images:
[source,shell]
docker compose build

3. *Start* the Docker containers:
[source,shell]
docker compose up

== Deploy the Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain using Hardhat.
This development environment helps developers manage the lifecycle of their smart contracts and provides a comprehensive environment for compiling, testing and deploying them.

While the blockchain network is running, follow these steps:

1. *Navigate* to the `smart-contracts` directory:
[source,shell]
cd smart-contracts

2. *Copy* the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
[source,shell]
cp .env.example .env

3. *Install* the dependencies:
[source,shell]
npm install

4. *Compile* the smart contracts:
[source,shell]
npm run compile

5. *Deploy* the Container smart contract to the blockchain network:
[source,shell]
npm run container-deploy-dev

6. *Deploy* the Token smart contract to the blockchain network:
[source,shell]
npm run token-deploy-dev

7. *Copy* the addresses of the deployed smart contracts from the terminal output and save them for the next section.

=== Start the Blockchain Connector

To start the blockchain connector, perform the following steps:

1. *Navigate* to the `blockchain-connector` directory:
[source,shell]
cd ../blockchain-connector

2. *Rename* the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
[source,shell]
mv .env.example .env

3. *Ensure* that the `BCC_CONTAINER_ADDRESS` and `BCC_TOKEN_ADDRESS` values in the `.env` file are set to the saved addresses of the deployed smart contracts from the previous section.

4. *Install* the dependencies:
[source,shell]
npm install

5. *Start* the blockchain connector:
[source,shell]
npm run start

== Test Communication between the Blockchain Connector and the Smart Contracts

To verify that the blockchain connector is successfully communicating with the smart contracts, follow these steps. (Ensure that the `BCC_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED` flag in the `.env` file is set to true.)

=== Mint a Token

1. *Open* a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/api`
2. *Click* on the `POST /tokens` endpoint to create a new token
3. *Select* `false` for the parameter `appendToHierarchy`
4. *Enter* the following JSON object in the request body:
[source,json]
{
    "remoteId": "dummy-1337",
    "asset": {
        "uri": "https://example.com/dummy-1337/image.jpg",
        "hash": "abcdef1234567890"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "uri": "https://example.com/dummy-1337/metadata.json",
        "hash": "1234567890abcdef"
    },
    "additionalData": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
        "parentIds": [
    ]
}
5. *Click* on the `Try it out` button to send the request

=== Fetch a Token

1. *Click* on the `GET /tokens` endpoint to retrieve the token
2. *Enter* the following value in the `remoteId` field: `dummy-1337`
3. *Click* on the `Try it out` button to send the request
4. *Verify* that the response contains a JSON object similar to the following:
[source,json]
[
    {
        "remoteId": "dummy-1337",
        "asset": {
            "uri": "https://example.com/dummy-1337/image.jpg",
            "hash": "abcdef1234567890"
        },
        "metadata": {
            "uri": "https://example.com/dummy-1337/metadata.json",
            "hash": "1234567890abcdef"
        },
        "additionalData": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
        "ownerAddress": "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",
        "minterAddress": "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",
        "createdOn": "2025-01-01T00:13:37.000Z",
        "lastUpdatedOn": "2025-01-01T00:13:37.000Z",
        "tokenId": "0",
        "tokenAddress": "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512"
    }
