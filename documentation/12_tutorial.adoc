== Tutorial

We describe the main usage scenarios of XXX.

=== Installation

The XXX is solely intended to be deployed to Kubernetes.

A scripted deployment of each of its components is possible and extensively used by CI/CD for the OpenShift distribution of Kubernetes.
The respective scripts are developed and maintained alongside the source code and are part of the same repositories.
A special case is the MongoDB which is used extensively for a lot of Silicon Economy Projects and for which the deployment script is therefore developed alongside similar deployment scripts centrally in a dedicated source code repository by the PDO.

A more detailed installation tutorial including deployment level component configuration is planned.
